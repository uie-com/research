                <br>
                <h2>How Strategic UX Research is different from what’s practiced today.</h2><br>
                <p>Most teams today practice <i>Tactical UX Research.</i> Their work rarely affects more than a
                    specific
                    feature or product.</p>
                <p>Their research results only describe immediate recommendations or changes that will improve the
                    product slightly.</p>

                <p>Tactical UX Research rarely improves our understanding of users or what they need in the long term.
                    This understanding
                    never reaches the organization’s upper levels. The most critical decisions, like budgets, staffing,
                    and priorities,
                    don’t consider the users’ experiences. Yet these decisions affect whether the team will have what it
                    needs to deliver a
                    great user experience.</p>

                <p>Conversely, <i>Strategic UX Research</i> is about attaining a deeper understanding of all the
                    different
                    users and their
                    individual experiences. Everyone, including the executive team, learns more about what makes an
                    excellent experience for
                    users, employees, and customers and how to improve their current experiences.</p>

                <p>These experiences go beyond using the organization’s products or services. They include what happens
                    before, during, and
                    after someone has interacted with the product. Strategic UX Research uncovers the entirety of
                    people's experiences.</p>

                <p>Research teams orchestrate <i>deep-hanging-out</i> sessions with customers and users. They collect
                    observations and insights that show what a day in the life of users could be like. They combine
                    different experiences with the
                    product or service across the user’s lifetime and connect this all together to show a detailed
                    journey.</p>

                <p>In this intensive, you’ll discover the basic principles of <i>Strategic UX Research:</i></p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Build deep expertise about users and their needs.</li>
                    <li>Focus the organization on improving the daily lives of customers, users, and employees.</li>
                    <li>Combine UX and CX practices to collect knowledge from every touch point.</li>
                    <li>Study holistic experiences instead of small slices of a product’s features.</li>
                    <li>Feed the research results into every outcome and decision.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>How this Intensive works.</h2>
                <br>
                <p>This is an online workshop unlike any other you’ve ever experienced. We call it an intensive
                    because,
                    well, it’s
                    intense.</p>
                <p>This intensive is an advanced program for UX, product, and development practitioners who already
                    understand the basics
                    of user experience. It will push you into new territory, exploring concepts and approaches
                    you’ve
                    likely never seen
                    before.</p>
                <p>Yet, once you hear Jared Spool explain them, you’ll feel like these ideas make complete sense.
                    That’s
                    because they’re a
                    natural next step to your lived experience.</p>
                <p>Every moment of every session presents new ideas and explores original ways to approach UX
                    research
                    practice. Past
                    attendees have told us they feel like what they learned revitalized their careers.</p>
                <p>The intensive consists of five 90-minute sessions, each led by Jared Spool. We hold each session
                    twice, at 12pm (16.00
                    GMT) and 6pm (22.00 GMT). You can attend either session. Jared will be at both to answer your
                    questions.</p>
                <p>Plus, each session’s recording is available the next day. That way, if you miss one, you can
                    catch up
                    quickly.</p>
                <p>You'll receive our <b>Strategic UX Research Leadership Guide</b> and detailed notes for each
                    session.
                    This essential guide will
                    help you reflect on your team’s current practices and plan the next steps for your
                    organization’s
                    Strategic UX Research
                    transformation</p>
                <p>You’ll have questions. We’re ready for that. Each 90-minute session will give us plenty of time
                    to
                    discuss how you’ll
                    make all this work in your situation.</p>
                <p>We’ll also ensure you have the confidence to do this right. We have created a dedicated private
                    area
                    in our Leaders of
                    Awesomeness community. Post your questions there so Jared and the community can share their
                    thoughts.</p>
                <p>Discuss the gnarliest of challenges, and you’ll come away with all the assurance you need that
                    you’ve
                    got this.</p>

                <p>Each day during the week, you’ll attend a 90-minute session containing a new aspect of Strategic UX
                    Research. You can choose the session that is best for your schedule. Jared will be at both to
                    introduce you to the fundamentals and answer your questions.</p>
                <p>Right now, you might just be “Strategic UX Research curious.” If so, our <b>The Fundamentals of
                        Strategic UX Research</b> package is precisely what you need.</p>

                <p>In the five daily sessions of the Fundamentals package, Jared Spool will introduce all the essential
                    concepts behind Strategic UX Research. You’ll explore how your research will influence your
                    organization’s priorities
                    and demonstrate your value up the org chart.</p>

                <p>Instead, you may be ready to start implementing changes. In that case, our <b>Prepare to Lead</b>
                    package is right for you.</p>

                <p>With the Prepare to Lead (PTL) package, you get all five sessions from the Fundamentals package and
                    an additional three 90-minute sessions the following week.</p>

                <p>These additional sessions cover the implementation details to start your organization’s
                    transformation. We limit the attendance at the PTL sessions, so you’ll get more of Jared’s time to
                    address your particular challenges.</p>

                <p>The PTL package also includes a pre-conference session, during which you’ll share your current
                    challenges with Jared. This way, he can tailor the sessions to your needs and supply you with extra
                    resources to give you additional insights into your transformation.</p>

                <p>Plus, the PTL package includes a 30-minute one-on-one coaching session with Jared that you can use
                    anytime after the Intensive. He’ll work with you to review what you’ve achieved at that point and
                    collaborate with you on
                    how to proceed with your transformation.</p>

                </p>
                <p>
                    All significant strategic decisions originate in your organization’s product roadmap. The roadmap
                    determines the
                    direction of your products and services, which determines your organization's direction. As a UX
                    leader, the roadmap is
                    your opportunity to have the most influence over user experiences.</p>
                <p>
                    Your Strategic UX Research will shape significant product decisions when you anticipate what those
                    decisions will be.
                    The roadmap is your essential fortune-telling device, predicting the future of every team’s work. As
                    a result, your
                    entire organization becomes more knowledgeable about what your users need when you read the roadmap
                    and discern what it
                    subtly is telling you.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Move beyond starting each project from scratch and instead begin with an in-depth knowledge of
                        what your users and
                        customers need.</li>
                    <li>Change your organization’s mindset from “we have to build a thing” to “we have to solve a
                        customer’s problem.”</li>
                    <li>Construct your long-term research agenda from the UX outcomes of each item currently on the
                        roadmap.</li>
                    <li>Add market-leading innovations to the roadmap that come directly from gaps you’ve uncovered in
                        your users’ experiences.</li>

                <p>Continuous research shifts everyone away from the project-by-project piecemeal nature of conventional
                    tactical approaches. Your new strategy will drive continuous learning, making everyone more

                </p>
                <p>
                    Strategic UX Research is more than a skill or a tool to master. It’s a mindset that drives curiosity

                <p>

                    drive dramatic change.
                    That change will speed the delivery of better-designed products and services to your customers.</p>

                        Connect your research directly to the organization’s highest priorities.</i></p>

                <p>You shouldn’t spend any more time explaining why research is essential. It’s time for action. Produce
                    insightful results
                    that demonstrate the rich value that Strategic UX Research brings.</p>

                <p>You need a direct mapping between your excellent research and your executives’ critical priorities.
                    Get the attention of
                    key stakeholders and executives. Supply them with irrefutable, compelling reasons to sponsor your
                    work and champion your
                    outcomes.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Move beyond the frustration of “nobody gets UX” when everyone sees its great value.</li>
                    <li>Match UX outcomes directly to the language executives use, making their achievement an
                        organizational top priority.</li>
                    <li>Translate the key frustrations of users and customers into something executives understand:
                        money.</li>
                    <li>Uncover the (often massive) financial implications of delivering poor UX design.</li>

                <p>Every decision your executives make affects the experiences your organization delivers to your
                    customers and users. When
                    they make those decisions without research, they’re taking huge risks. Risks that often don’t pan
                    out the way they’d
                    like.</p>

                <p>Your Strategic UX Research can reduce those risks. As you build expertise about users and their needs
                    throughout the
                    organization, you’re making it easier to make informed decisions. Those decisions will prioritize

                <ul>

                    <li>Become the leader your executives need you to be so they can rely on your insights to drive the

                        right direction.</li>

                <p>The last thing you want is for your UX team to be invisible to your executives. Fortunately,

                <h3>Led by Jared Spool, Maker of Awesomeness</h3>
                <p>Everything you learn in this Intensive comes directly from Jared’s years of working across
                    industries, discovering the
                    best practices for organizations to deliver well-designed products and services.</p>

                <p>His experience working with design leaders of organizations like IBM, NASA, GE, Fidelity Investments,
                    SAP, GM, Exxon
                    Mobil, and the Obama White House has taught him exactly what teams need to mount strategic,
                    influential UX research
                    initiatives.</p>

                <p>You’ll love his stories, ability to demonstrate every point with a simple, concrete example, and
                    comically adorable
                    attempts to draw out his ideas. (You can’t fault him for trying, though.)</p>

                <p>Most importantly, you’ll love how much brighter you’ll feel after spending a few minutes absorbing
                    his
                    experience-informed wisdom. Don’t pass up this opportunity to glean everything you can from Jared.
