                </h2>

                <p>UX leaders often talk about the importance of <em>“having a seat at the table.”</em> However, what’s
                    critical is <em>what we bring to the table.</em> </p>
                <p>Right now, your organization faces vital decisions. Decisions that will determine whether the future
                    results in
                    delivering great products or mediocre ones. Decisions that will determine the best way to focus
                    limited resources. If
                    made right, the choices will delight customers and, if made wrong, they will cost the organization
                    money and reputation.</p>
                <p>When high-level decision-makers need to make important decisions, do they have the data and insights
                    to guide them to
                    the best choices? The data and insights are the product of advanced user research. It’s the
                    superpower that UX leaders,
                    just like you, can bring to the table.</p>
                <p>Spend five 90-minute sessions discovering what your UX research efforts genuinely need. Put together
                    a plan that makes
                    your UX team strategic, influential, and innovative.</p>

                    This online workshop will be unlike any other workshop you’ve experienced. We call it an intensive
                    because, well, it’s
                    intense.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In five 90-minute sessions, you’ll join Jared Spool on a thorough exploration of how to shape the
                    way your organization
                    makes critical decisions. You’ll complete your journey with a comprehensive UX research strategy
                    that will change your
                    organization forever.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Your research practice will build expertise around users and customers across the organization.
                    You’ll no longer
                    underinvest in research. Stakeholders and executives will use your UX research findings for
                    essential decision-making
                    instead of just guessing.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Each day, from Monday, June 5 through Friday, June 9, you’ll attend a 90-minute session containing a
                    new aspect of
                    Advanced Approaches to UX Research.
                </p>

                <p>
                    You can choose between the 12pm ET (16.00 GMT) or 7pm ET (23.00 GMT) sessions. Jared will be at both
                    to guide you
                    through the fundamentals and answer your questions.

                    <p>
                        All significant strategic decisions originate in your organization’s product roadmap. The
                        roadmap determines the
                        direction of your products and services. As a UX leader, the roadmap is your opportunity to get
                        the most influence over
                        the users’ experiences.

                    <p>
                        Your user research will shape significant product decisions when you anticipate what those
                        decisions will be. The
                        roadmap is an essential fortune-telling device, predicting the future of every team’s work. As a
                        result, your entire
                        organization becomes more knowledgeable about what your users need when you read the roadmap and
                        discern what it subtly
                        is telling you.

                        So much of today’s user research efforts are about squeezing what you learn into refining a
                        close-to-done feature or
                        capability. That’s not the point of research. To get the most out of your efforts, you need to
                        uncover the holistic
                        experiences of your users and customers.

                    <p>

                        conventional approaches. Your
                        new strategy will drive continuous learning, making everyone more knowledgeable as your team

                <p><em>Roll up your sleeves and plan to get to work.</em></p>
                <p>There won’t be fake companies to create an over-simplified research strategy for. Nothing here will
                    be
                    “practice.”</p>
                <p>Instead, you’ll be doing the actual work of crafting your team’s UX research strategy. You’ll start
                    drafting the
                    blueprints for what change will look like across your organization.</p>
                <p>You’ll use your <strong>Advanced UX Research Transformation Plan</strong> to guide your efforts.
                    Then,
                    you’ll start applying
                    everything you learn right away.</p>
                <p>You’ll come away from the intensive with your own custom approach to UX research. Bring your team in
                    on
                    the process, and
                    you’ll have even better results.</p>
                <p>Might miss a session? No worries. We’ll record everything, so you can catch up on anything you miss.
                </p>
                <p>You’ll have questions. We’re ready for that. Each session is 90 minutes, so we should have plenty of
                    time.</p>
                <p>And we’ll ensure you have the confidence you need to do this right. We have created a dedicated
                    private
                    area in our
                    Leaders of Awesomeness community. Put your questions there for Jared and the community to share
                    their
                    thoughts.</p>
                <p>Discuss the gnarliest of challenges, and you’ll come away with all the assurance you need that you’ve
                    got
                    this.</p>
